This repository implements a simplified [PoC](./test/MetamorphicContract.t.sol) that showcases how a contract can morph using a combination of `CREATE2`, `CREATE`, and `SELFDESTRUCT`. A similar approach was used as part of the [governance attack on Tornado Cash](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1660012956632104960)[^1] in May 2023.
